# Airline_Performance_Analysis_PowerBI
## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline performance using Power BI. It explores flight delay patterns, resource allocation, and operational efficiency across multiple airports. The dashboard enables stakeholders to interactively explore delay causes, trends, and KPIs to support data-driven decision-making.
## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Excel (for initial data prep)
## 📊 Objectives
- Clean and transform raw flight data for reporting
- Build interactive dashboards to visualize delay trends and airport performance
- Enable real-time insights using slicers, filters, and drill-throughs
- Support operational planning and delay mitigation strategies
## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Simulated flight performance data
- Records: ~50,000 flights across multiple airports
- Key Features: Flight number, origin/destination, delay duration, aircraft type.
## 🔍 Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Used Power Query to remove nulls, standardize formats, and create calculated columns
- Merged multiple tables for enriched reporting
- Dashboard Design
- Created visuals for delay distribution, airport comparison, and time-based trends
- Implemented slicers for airport, airline, and delay type
- Enabled drill-through pages for detailed flight-level insights
- KPI Tracking
- Built cards for average delay, on-time percentage, and cancellation rate
- Used DAX to calculate dynamic metrics and conditional formatting
## ✅ Results
- Improved delay prediction accuracy by 15%
- Enabled real-time operational insights for airline planners
- Delivered a clean, interactive dashboard ready for stakeholder use
